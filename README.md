# Solar System Simulation with Unity

Welcome to my Solar System Simulation project developed using Unity! This is my first Unity project. In this project, I've aimed to model a solar system within the Unity game engine.

## Features

- **Realistic Ratios**: I've strived to maintain accurate ratios of rotational velocities and sizes for a more realistic representation of the solar system. (However, I kept the interplanetary distance very small as I wanted them all to be visible on the camera.)

- **User Interaction**: The simulation offers user interactivity through the following features:
  - **Velocity Control**: Users can adjust the velocities of the planets using an intuitive slider interface.
  - **Camera Views**: By pressing the space key, users can switch between three different camera views to observe the solar system from various angles.
  - **Program Exit**: Users can easily close the program by clicking the cross button.

## Getting Started

To explore the simulation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/beyzayildizli/Unity_SolarSystem.git`
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Run the simulation in the Unity editor.

Feel free to experiment with the planet velocities, camera angles, and other interactive features to enhance your experience!

## Contribution

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's make this solar system simulation even better, together.
